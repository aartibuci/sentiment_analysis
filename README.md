Project Description: Sentiment Analysis in Python
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis in Python, leveraging two distinct techniques:

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner):
A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.
Uses a bag-of-words approach to analyze the sentiment of text data.

RoBERTa Pretrained Model from Huggingface:
An advanced, transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus of text.
Utilizes the Huggingface pipeline for sentiment analysis to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

Objectives:
To understand and implement sentiment analysis using VADER and the RoBERTa model.
To compare the effectiveness and accuracy of a traditional bag-of-words approach with a modern transformer-based model.

Tools and Libraries:
VADER Sentiment Analysis: A pre-built Python library for social media sentiment analysis.
Huggingface's Transformers: A library providing general-purpose architectures for natural language understanding, including the RoBERTa model.

Matplotlib: For visualizing data and analysis results.

Steps:

Data Preparation:
Load and preprocess text data for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis with VADER:
Apply VADER to classify the sentiment of each text entry.
Visualize the distribution of sentiment scores.

Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa:
Use the Huggingface pipeline to apply the RoBERTa model to the text data.
Compare the results with the VADER analysis.

Results and Comparison:
Evaluate the performance of both techniques.
Discuss the pros and cons of each approach.

This project is ideal for those interested in natural language processing and sentiment analysis, offering a hands-on comparison of traditional and modern techniques.
